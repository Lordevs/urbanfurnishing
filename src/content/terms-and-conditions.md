# Terms and Conditions for Urban Furnishing

**Effective Date:** February 2026

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Urban Furnishing ("we", "our", "us"). By accessing our website (www.urbanfurnishing.com) and engaging our services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. These terms govern the provision of our interior furnishing and design services.

## 2. Our Services & Packages

Urban Furnishing provides curated, end-to-end furnishing solutions through structured pathways, including but not limited to:

- **Investor Turnkey:** Fast, neutral, rental-ready packages tailored for landlords and property portfolios.
- **End-User Signature:** Highly personalized, curated selections balancing design coherence and budget control.
- **Developer / Bulk:** Scalable, repeatable furnishing templates designed for multiple units or new development launches.

While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our package descriptions, timelines, and inclusions, we reserve the right to substitute items of equal or greater value in the event of supply chain shortages.

## 3. The Urban Furnishing Process

### 3.1 Consultation & Package Selection

Initial consultations are intended to outline property scope, budget constraints, and delivery timelines. Following this, we will formally recommend an applicable furnishing pathway.

### 3.2 Scope Confirmation & Timeline

Upon selecting a package, a specialized **Scope Document and Pricing Agreement** will be provided. A project is not officially commenced until this agreement is signed and the requisite initial deposit is paid. All quoted timelines (e.g., 2-12 weeks based on package selection) begin from the date of cleared funds.

### 3.3 Procurement & Installation

We maintain sole discretion over our procurement network. To ensure quality control, clients may not substitute or provide their own standalone pieces for partial installation by our team unless expressly approved in writing during the Scope Confirmation phase.

### 3.4 Handover & Support

Upon project completion, our dedicated site lead will conduct a final property walkthrough. Clients are responsible for inspecting the property and noting any immediate defects at the time of handover.

## 4. Ordering, Pricing, and Payments

- **Pricing:** All pricing is subject to confirmation via the individualized Scope Document. Base package prices listed on the website or promotional materials are illustrative and subject to final property dimensions and client constraints.
- **Payments:** Due to the upfront custom procurement nature of our business, a structured payment schedule will be enforced (typically requiring a substantial upfront deposit before any ordering occurs).

## 5. Refunds and Cancellations

Deposits allocated toward the procurement of bespoke, custom-ordered, or imported furniture pieces are **non-refundable** once production or dispatch has commenced.
Standard package cancellations may incur a restocking or administrative fee if cancelled after the Scope Confirmation has been signed.

## 6. Access to Property

By engaging our installation services, you grant our team, our contractors, and delivery personnel safe, unobstructed access to the property during the agreed-upon installation windows. You are responsible for ensuring elevators, loading bays, and utilities are active and accessible.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All design presentations, floor-plans, styling layouts, and website assets remain the intellectual property of Urban Furnishing. You may not reproduce, distribute, or present our proprietary designs to competing third-party contractors without our written consent.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

Urban Furnishing shall not be liable for any delayed installations resulting from force majeure events, severe supply chain disruptions, or the client's failure to grant property access. Our total liability regarding damages to property during installation is strictly limited to the value of our active insurance policies corresponding to the contract.
