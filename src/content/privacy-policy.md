# Privacy Policy for Urban Furnishing

**Effective Date:** February 2026

## 1. Introduction

Urban Furnishing ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information that you share with us. This Privacy Policy details the types of data we collect, how we use it, and how we safeguard it when you visit our website (www.urbanfurnishing.com) or book our end-to-end furnishing services.

## 2. Information We Collect

To effectively manage our Turnkey, Signature, and Developer furnishing packages, we collect the following:

### Personal & Contact Information

- Names, email addresses, and phone numbers provided via our "Book Consultation" forms.
- Billing details, bank transfers, or payment card information processed securely when confirming a project scope.

### Property & Project Information

- Physical addresses, floor plans, layout documents, or photography of the property intended for furnishing.
- Access codes, key locations, or security desk protocols required for our installation teams to enter the premises.

### Automatically Collected Data

- Device types, IP addresses, and browsing behavior on our platform, gathered via standard website analytics to improve our digital interface.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We strictly use the information collected for the following operational purposes:

- **Project Execution:** To accurately scope, design, deliver, and install furniture in your designated property.
- **Communication:** To provide you with timeline milestones, delivery alerts, and handover documentation.
- **Security & Verification:** To process secure payments and verify the legal ownership or tenancy rights to the property we are servicing.
- **Service Enhancement:** To analyze website metrics and refine our digital portfolio and package offerings.

## 4. Sharing Your Information

We operate as a fully managed service, which occasionally requires sharing partial data with trusted third parties:

- **Logistics & Delivery Partners:** Sharing property addresses and immediate contact data to ensure timely freight drop-offs.
- **Specialized Contractors:** If custom joinery, electrical, or specialized installations are required, your property details (and relevant floor plans) may be temporarily shared with vetted subcontractors.
- **Payment Processors:** To securely manage high-value transactions regarding invoice settlements.

_We will never sell, lease, or rent your personal data to external marketing agencies._

## 5. Security of Keys and Access Codes

We understand that you entrust us with access to your properties. All physical keys, fob devices, and digital alarm codes are highly restricted, logged internally by your dedicated Project Manager, and only distributed to the active installation team on the direct day of service.

## 6. Retention of Data

We retain your property layouts, design templates, and invoicing history indefinitely to provide swift post-handover support, process warranty claims on furniture, or rapidly deploy future packages for repeat Developer / Bulk clients.

## 7. Your Data Rights

Depending on your local jurisdiction, you hold the right to:

- Request an exported file of the personal data we hold about you.
- Request corrections to any inaccurate billing or property information.
- Request the deletion of your personal data (excluding data we are legally obligated to retain for tax, security, or contractual liability purposes).
